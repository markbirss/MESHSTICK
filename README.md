diy CH341 USB-TO-SPI SX1262 LoRa Meshstick that you can have manufactured or part assembled and finish by just adding the USB 2.0 connector, Waveshare SX1262 TXCO Core LoRa module and SMA anntenna connector

Waveshare SX1262 TXCO Core module is on the back side of the board.

More versions being evaluated are SX1280, 1W eByte E22, wio sx1262, LR1110 and LR1121

Version 1 did not have the 24C02 I2C flash chip that is being used to store a unique serial number for the device. 

The 2 pin jumper is populated when you want to program the flash chip.
(IMSProg is used in the example bellow)

```
5312cc00861a12550403000000000000
32303030303031360000000000000000

59204d45534854415354494300000000
```
Remove the jumper for normal use (once the 24C02 flash is programmed)

Confirm that your unique iSerial is actually read from the device (with jumper removed)
e.g using lsusb

```
lsusb | grep CH341
Bus 001 Device 016: ID 1a86:5512 QinHeng Electronics CH341 in EPP/MEM/I2C mode, EPP/I2C adapter
```

**Use the device number 016 above for -s**
```
lsusb -s 016 -v|grep -i iserial
  iSerial                 3 20000016
```

if I2c flash is really needed connect other side - but after flashing the eeeprom you will need to cut pin1 of ch341

**UPDATE** [2025-05-05]


Piggystick also works mounted in front with a flipped pcb (you can even swap radio modules out )

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c78452f4-b839-4c28-ae2a-e11569d04324)

Newer editions of the CH341B dongles are also supported and working as expected
